# Text2RenPy (In Early Stages of Development!)
## Introduction
A basic python program that transforms screenplays into Ren'Py game code to promote a better visual novel development workflow.

When developing any Ren'Py game, independent developers are often tasked with juggling their game's narrative alongside their code, sound, and music. While some independent developers eventually find their preferred workflow, the worflow itself is incredibly tedious and draining to many developers. To help these struggling devs, I decided to start developing _Text2RenPy_ which aims to give developers the ability to turn already written stories into otherwise tedious Ren'Py code. I will continue to update this as I go!
