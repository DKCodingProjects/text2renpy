# DEVELOPER RESOURCES (IN DEVELOPMENT!)

To those interested in developing this program further, I have provided you with resources to help you understand my code and approach.

## Overview

Because this program was initally designed to only generate Ren'Py (Render Python) code, it was built in Python since it is the only coding language required for Ren'Py. Thus, the intention was for users to not need to download other software to use text2code out of the box. With that said, I've taken an object-oriented approach to verbously segregate classes and standardize their implementation. ***More to be added
